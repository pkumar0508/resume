Resume
======

- Typeset in LaTeX
- Version control allows for easy retrieval of old versions
- PDF output by default with `pdflatex`
- `resume.cls` (slightly modified from [LaTeXTemplates.com](http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com), see source)
gives a traditional resume style.
- Separation of content from style makes it easy to update resume.
